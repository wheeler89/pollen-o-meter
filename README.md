# pollen-o-meter
Seminararbeit DHBW CAS, Grundlagen Web Engineering, Master Informatik

This SPA demonstrates its functionality without a server (only static github page) and uses modified testdata of "Source: Deutscher Wetterdienst" (DWD). Purpose of this modification is to check the functionality of the main information element, which gives a visual feedback of the pollen risk for every federal state of germany. The map shows a background color depending on the risk of the pollen flight and does not make any difference between specific pollen types. As soon as only one type of pollen of a region or subregion has a high risk on DWD index, the background color of this hole federal state will be changed by a bunch of functions. In addition, the map of germany is the main interactive navigation element which allows pseudo navigation by a event listener on hashchange. More detailed pollen risk information will be displayed for a specific federal state by a click driven event on the map (also for subregions, when data from DWD is available). The apps landing page can also be called when clicking on the title Pollen-O-Meter. To enable responsiveness, two grids with a container like design using semantic elements (one with media query) and some auto adjustments comes in handy. For live data a serverside XMLHttpRequest is needed cause of CORS policy. A node.js server has been implemented in this project for a exam only locally and is not published on github.
